# RiboRid Design 
This package helps you desing oligos for riborid protocol for rRNA depletion. The package requires input rRNA sequence or genbank file from your target organism. If no sequence information is available for your organism/strain, you can try using sequence from closely related organism as rRNA sequences tend to be highly conserved.
